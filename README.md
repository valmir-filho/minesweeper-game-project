## Content:

- Minesweeper Game Project developed in Python.

## Instructions:

- Install Python: First, ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/);

- Verify Python Installation: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and run python3 --version;

- Install Pygame: Now, install Pygame using pip. In the terminal, run pip3 install pygame;

- Create the Game File: Open a text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad);
  
- Copy the Python code (minesweeper_game.py) into the editor;

- Save the file as minesweeper_game.py;

- Run the Game: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you saved pong_game.py;

- Run the game with: python3 minesweeper_game.py.

## Game Instructions:

- The goal of the game is to reveal all the cells on the grid without clicking on any mines. If you click on a cell containing a mine, the game is over;

- Left-click: Reveal a cell. If the revealed cell has no adjacent mines, it will display a number indicating how many mines are nearby (in the 8 surrounding cells). If there are no adjacent mines, it will automatically reveal surrounding cells until it reaches cells with numbers;
  
- Right-click: Flag a cell. If you suspect a cell contains a mine, right-click to place a flag. This is helpful to mark potential mines and avoid clicking on them by mistake;

- Game Over: If you click on a cell that contains a mine, the game will end, and all mines will be revealed. A pop-up will appear, asking if you want to play again or quit the game;
  
- Winning: You win the game if you successfully reveal all cells without mines. A congratulatory message will appear, and you will have the option to start a new game or exit;

- Tips: Use numbers as clues: If you reveal a cell with a number, it tells you how many mines are adjacent to that cell. Use this information to figure out where the mines are likely located;
  
- Flagging: Right-click to place a flag where you think a mine is, helping you keep track of potential danger spots.

### Used IDE: Visual Studio Code.
